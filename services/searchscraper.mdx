## Advanced Usage

### Custom Schema Example

Define exactly what data you want to extract using Pydantic or Zod:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

class CompanyProfile(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Company name")
    description: str = Field(description="Brief company description")
    founded_year: str = Field(description="Year the company was founded")
    headquarters: str = Field(description="Company headquarters location")
    employees: str = Field(description="Number of employees")
    industry: str = Field(description="Primary industry")
    products: List[str] = Field(description="Main products or services")
    competitors: List[str] = Field(description="Major competitors")
    market_share: str = Field(description="Company's market share")
    revenue: str = Field(description="Annual revenue")
    tech_stack: List[str] = Field(description="Technologies used by the company")

response = client.searchscraper(
    user_prompt="Find comprehensive information about OpenAI",
    output_schema=CompanyProfile
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { z } from 'zod';

const CompanyProfile = z.object({
  name: z.string().describe('Company name'),
  description: z.string().describe('Brief company description'),
  foundedYear: z.string().describe('Year the company was founded'),
  headquarters: z.string().describe('Company headquarters location'),
  employees: z.string().describe('Number of employees'),
  industry: z.string().describe('Primary industry'),
  products: z.array(z.string()).describe('Main products or services'),
  competitors: z.array(z.string()).describe('Major competitors'),
  marketShare: z.string().describe('Company\'s market share'),
  revenue: z.string().describe('Annual revenue'),
  techStack: z.array(z.string()).describe('Technologies used by the company')
});

const response = await client.search({
  userPrompt: 'Find comprehensive information about OpenAI',
  outputSchema: CompanyProfile
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Async Support

For applications requiring asynchronous execution:

```python
from scrapegraph_py import AsyncClient
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with AsyncClient(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
        
        response = await client.searchscraper(
            user_prompt="Analyze the current AI chip market",
        )
        
        # Process the structured results
        market_data = response.result
        print(f"Market Size: {market_data['market_overview']['total_size']}")
        print(f"Growth Rate: {market_data['market_overview']['growth_rate']}")
        print("\nKey Players:")
        for player in market_data['market_overview']['key_players']:
            print(f"- {player}")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Integration Options

### Official SDKs
- [Python SDK](/sdks/python) - Perfect for data science and backend applications

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization
1. Be specific in your prompts
2. Use descriptive queries
3. Include relevant context
4. Specify time-sensitive requirements

### Schema Design
- Start with essential fields
- Use appropriate data types
- Add field descriptions
- Make optional fields nullable
- Group related information

### Rate Limiting
