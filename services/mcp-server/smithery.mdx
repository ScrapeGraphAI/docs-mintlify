## Installation

Install the ScrapeGraph MCP Server using Smithery's CLI:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @ScrapeGraphAI/scrapegraph-mcp --client claude
```

This command will:
- Automatically download and configure the MCP server
- Set up the necessary configuration files
- Prompt you for your API key if needed

## Supported Clients

Smithery currently supports installation for:
- **Claude Desktop** - Full support with automatic configuration
- Other MCP-compatible clients may be added in the future

## Configuration

After installation, Smithery will configure your client's MCP settings. You may need to:

1. **Provide your API key** - Enter your ScrapeGraph API key when prompted
2. **Restart your client** - Restart Claude Desktop or your MCP client to load the new server
3. **Verify connection** - Test the connection by asking your AI assistant to use one of the MCP tools

## API Key

You'll need a ScrapeGraph API key to use the MCP server. Get one from the [ScrapeGraph Dashboard](https://dashboard.scrapegraphai.com) if you haven't already.

## Alternative Installation Methods

While Smithery provides a convenient installation method, you can also set up the MCP server using:

## When to Use Smithery

Smithery is a good choice if you:
- Prefer automated installation and configuration
- Want to manage multiple MCP servers easily
- Use Claude Desktop as your primary client
- Like the convenience of a package manager approach

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Smithery installation:

1. **Check Node.js version** - Ensure you have Node.js installed (npx requires Node.js)
2. **Verify API key** - Make sure your ScrapeGraph API key is valid
3. **Check client logs** - Review Claude Desktop logs for connection errors:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\Logs\\`
4. **Manual configuration** - If Smithery doesn't work, try the [manual setup methods](/services/mcp-server/cursor)
