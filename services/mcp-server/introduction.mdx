## Recommended: Remote HTTP Endpoint

The easiest way to get started is using our hosted MCP endpoint:

```
https://mcp.scrapegraphai.com/mcp
```

This requires no local installation and works seamlessly with both Cursor and Claude Desktop. See the setup guides above for configuration details.

## Local Installation

Prefer running locally? You can install the Python package and run it via stdio. This gives you more control and doesn't require internet connectivity for the MCP connection itself.

<Note>
  The remote endpoint is recommended for most users as it's simpler to set up and maintain.
</Note>
