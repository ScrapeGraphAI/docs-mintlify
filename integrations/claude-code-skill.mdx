## Overview

The ScrapeGraphAI [Claude Code Skill](https://github.com/ScrapeGraphAI/skill) gives AI coding agents full access to ScrapeGraphAI's web scraping, search, and crawling APIs. Once installed, agents like Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and Cline can scrape websites, extract structured data, and crawl pages — all from natural language prompts.

## Installation

<Steps>

### Option 1: Install via skills.sh (Recommended)

The fastest way to install. Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

```bash
npx skills add ScrapeGraphAI/skill
```

This clones the skill and symlinks it into your `~/.claude/skills/` directory automatically.

### Option 2: Manual install

Clone the repository and create the symlink yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ScrapeGraphAI/skill.git ~/.claude/skills/scrapegraphai
ln -sf ~/.claude/skills/scrapegraphai/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/scrapegraphai.md
```

### Option 3: Project-level install

Install the skill for a single project only:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/ScrapeGraphAI/skill.git .claude/skills/scrapegraphai
ln -sf .claude/skills/scrapegraphai/SKILL.md .claude/skills/scrapegraphai.md
```

</Steps>

## Setup

Set your ScrapeGraphAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export SGAI_API_KEY="sgai-..."
```

<Note>
Get your API key from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.scrapegraphai.com).
</Note>

## Example Prompts

Once the skill is installed, you can use natural language prompts directly in your AI coding agent:

```text
Scrape https://example.com/products and extract all product names, prices, and ratings
```

```text
Search the web for "best React UI libraries 2025" and extract the top 5 with pros and cons
```

```text
Convert https://example.com/docs/getting-started to markdown and save it to docs/
```

```text
Crawl https://example.com/blog with depth 2 and extract the title and summary from each post
```

```text
Get all URLs from the sitemap of https://example.com
```

```text
Log into https://example.com/dashboard, click "Reports", and extract the table data
```

The agent will automatically select the right ScrapeGraphAI endpoint, handle authentication, poll for async results, and return structured data.
