## Overview

The Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) integration enables your agents to leverage ScrapeGraphAI's powerful web scraping, crawling, and data extraction capabilities. This integration allows you to build sophisticated AI agents that can understand and process web content intelligently.

## Installation

Install the ScrapeGraphAI MCP server package (requires Python 3.13 or higher):

```bash
pip install scrapegraph-mcp
```

## Use with Agent

### Local MCP Server

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import MCPToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StdioConnectionParams
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

SGAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_SCRAPEGRAPHAI_API_KEY"

root_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.5-pro",
    name="scrapegraph_assistant_agent",
    instruction="""Help the user with web scraping and data extraction using
ScrapeGraph AI. You can convert webpages to markdown, extract
structured data using AI, perform web searches, crawl
multiple pages, and automate complex scraping workflows.""",
    tools=[
        MCPToolset(
            connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
                server_params=StdioServerParameters(
                    # The following CLI command is available
                    # from `pip install scrapegraph-mcp`
                    command="scrapegraph-mcp",
                    env={
                        "SGAI_API_KEY": SGAI_API_KEY,
                    },
                ),
                timeout=300,
            ),
            # Optional: Filter which tools from the MCP server are exposed
            # tool_filter=["markdownify", "smartscraper", "searchscraper"]
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `markdownify` | Transform any webpage into clean, structured markdown format |
| `smartscraper` | Leverage AI to extract structured data from any webpage with support for infinite scrolling |
| `searchscraper` | Execute AI-powered web searches with structured, actionable results |
| `scrape` | Basic scraping endpoint to fetch page content with optional heavy JavaScript rendering |
| `sitemap` | Extract sitemap URLs and structure for any website |
| `smartcrawler_initiate` | Initiate intelligent multi-page web crawling (asynchronous operation) |
| `smartcrawler_fetch_results` | Retrieve results from asynchronous crawling operations |
| `agentic_scrapper` | Run advanced agentic scraping workflows with customizable steps and structured output schemas |

## Configuration

Set your ScrapeGraphAI API key:

```python
SGAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

<Note>
Get your API key from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.scrapegraphai.com)
</Note>

## Tool Filtering

You can optionally filter which tools from the MCP server are exposed to your agent:

```python
MCPToolset(
    connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(...),
    tool_filter=["markdownify", "smartscraper", "searchscraper"]
)
```

This allows you to limit the agent's capabilities to only the tools you need for your specific use case.
