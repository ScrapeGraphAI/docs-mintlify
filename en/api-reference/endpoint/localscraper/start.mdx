LocalScraper works similarly to SmartScraper but accepts HTML content directly instead of a URL. This is useful when you already have the HTML content or need to scrape content that requires authentication.

### Key Features
- Process HTML content directly
- No URL required
- Supports large HTML files (up to 2MB)
- Same AI-powered extraction capabilities as SmartScraper
